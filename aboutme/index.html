    <h2>Emilio Lopez</h2>
    <p>Hi guys! my name is Emilio Lopez. I'm pursuing a  degree in Applied Technology, and I'm so excited to begin this course.</p>
    <p>Actually I'm working as a computer teacher, I have two weeks working as a professor, totally a new experience.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are doing calisthenics (I really love that one), and playing video games with friend (I don't do it if I'm alone because I get bored), my favorite video game is Super Smash Bros. </p>
    <p>That's a little bit about me. Have a nice day *-*</p>
